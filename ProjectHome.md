This is an engine which draws its most attention on the logic and tactics of a soccer game.
Integrated with it by simple interfaces, you can run a whole soccer game with your own front-end program which only needs to deal with the graphic and interactive part of the game.
Since this engine is totally separated from the front-end part, your own front-end program can be implemented in any language, using any graphic interface(eg. OpenGL), and the whole game can finally be either 2D or 3D or even on console.

**Notice:** The _testGUI_ included in the project is a front-end mentioned above just for testing and demo.

**Controls** in testGUI:
> "W S A D" to move player in up, down, left, and right directions.

> "SPACE" to shot or tackle.

> "K" to catch up with ball, and pass if holding ball.

> "L" to long pass.


> "RIGHT, LEFT and MIDDLE buttons of mouse" to change view point.

> "ESC" to quit.

> "R" to restart the game.
